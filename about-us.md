# About Us

Quran Kareem is a simple and lightweight app developed by Ahmed Elghareeb to make it easier for users to access and read the Holy Quran.

The app displays all Surahs in Arabic and English along with their number of verses. It also allows users to switch between Arabic and English interface languages.

There are no ads, no tracking, and no distractions â€” just the Holy Quran in a clean format.
